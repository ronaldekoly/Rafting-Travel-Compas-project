      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Adventuring in <strong><em>Rafting Travel Compas</em></strong> it takes
        a while to learn the river, but once done, it feels like you have been
        doing it your whole life. That’s when We knew that the River Adventures
        was home for many Adventurer, or we guess more of a retreat. When
        they're out there, they're in a state of flow. Even a bad day on the
        river is better than a good day in most other places. We realized this
        about halfway through our first summer. That’s when we knew that we can
        deliver. Rafting trips come off kind of pricey at first glance, but when
        you start to break it down, turns out they’re actually pretty reasonable
        considering it’s a full day or more of entertainment. Not to mention,
        all trips come complete with expert guides, gourmet food spreads (with
        at least 4 different types of mustard if you go with the right outfitter
        – hint, hint) and lots of new memories to go home with. Yeah that’s
        pretty priceless.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Rafting Travel Compas</em></strong> welcomes, people looking
        to explore the river in a fun way or in search of excitement in a
        different way. We provide excellent souvenirs from young person as 10
        years old to an adult or family seeking new challenging fun adventures
        in water rafting. That is what we offer and exactly what you need. Let’s
        be honest, our day-to-day lives are overrun with technology. Everyone
        and their unborn children are posting on Facebook about what they had
        for dinner, while simultaneously Snapchatting all the steps it took to
        make said dinner. This is your chance to leave all that hoopla behind,
        and just simply be surrounded by the beauty of our planet. It’s time to
        get away from all the craziness, unwind from the stress of your job and
        escape from the hustle and bustle. No phones, no computers, no service.
        Just think how much your future self will thank you, once you’re well
        rested and back on good terms with your old pal, Mother Nature.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
